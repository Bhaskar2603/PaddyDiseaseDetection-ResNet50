# 🌾 Paddy Crop Disease Detection using ResNet50

This project focuses on detecting diseases in paddy leaves using the **ResNet50** deep learning architecture. The model classifies images of paddy leaves into multiple disease categories, enabling early detection and treatment for better crop yield.

## 📌 Model Architecture: ResNet50

- Used **ResNet50** pretrained model from ImageNet.
- Finetuned hyper parameters according to the dataset

## 📊 Dataset

- Collected from Kaggle and other open datasets.
- Includes thermal and RGB images of diseased and healthy paddy leaves.
- Applied data augmentation to increase model generalization.

## ⚙️ Features

- Disease classification based on visible symptoms.
- Achieved high accuracy through fine-tuning and optimized pre-processing.
- Robust model evaluation using precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
- Matplotlib, NumPy
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
